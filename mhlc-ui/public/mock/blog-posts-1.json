The boy straightened upright while enjoying the view far above the rest of us watching the bit of family circus. Later, the father said that sadly it wouldn’t continue to happen too much longer because a) the boy was growing and getting heavier, and b) his son would soon enough conclude that he probably couldn’t trust even his parents, whether true or not. As a toddler, he implicitly trusted mommy and daddy but would learn that one can easily fall, and not even mommy or daddy could protect him from all the bumps and bruises life provides.",

The teaching Jesus commends about children is the abiding trust they first place in their parents, then siblings and close friends. The circle continues to widen as time passes. However, disappointments, not to mention betrayals, outright lying, cheating, or abuse, all limit our early childhood trust in those folks who first loved us. Caution is certainly necessary as we mature as well as begin to understand healthy boundaries and mutual respect for one another. However, Jesus’ “Children’s Moment” underscores an abiding truth about the God Jesus continues to reveal to us. ",

Horeb is indeed “…high and lifted up.” Nevertheless, the potential of the parish name, the type of welcome we and strangers alike give and receive, the desire to center on God’s presence and not our own distractions, the holy offer of honesty and forgiveness before God and one another, God’s Word read and pondered, the preaching, prayers, singing, the meal Christ Jesus himself offers, and our being sent forth (uphill or down) to do the holy work we’ve been equipped to fulfill is hopefully why we’ve come in the first place.",

There usually is a family point-person in charge of dinner, laundry, and all other necessities. As I was growing up, my parents happily shared domestic and parental responsibilities across the board which included us when at long last we could see over the top of the counter. If mom worked late [she was a bank clerk], dad started the laundry or got dinner going. He also could steer a vacuum cleaner. My siblings and I soon learned how to assemble a passable sandwich and pour a glass of milk when necessary, make our beds, clean up the table. I learned to feed the dog. We all variously washed and dried the dishes. To be fair, mother also could wield a mean hammer [actually, and at times figuratively], doing her share of nailing when dad was building the garage. I did look forward to the evenings she was away at choir practice because dad was more daring in the kitchen than she.

Jesus himself was even vexed by the issue as we heard in the concluding gospels during Easter.

Once the vanilla extract has been made, take out the beans, dry them off, and put them in a jar of granulated sugar [infusion technique #2]. If you’ve never tasted vanilla sugar sprinkled on top of baked goods or made homemade whipped cream, you’ve a treat in store for you.

One dictionary defines “neutral” as “…’neither helping nor contributing to any particular side or understanding” in the midst of conflict or need. In this case neutral is a synonym for “impartial” or “disengaged.” Another definition suggests that neutral has “…no strongly marked or positive characters or features,” an odd descripter for followers of Jesus. During Israel’s exodus out of bondage God gifts Moses with commandments or teachings to remind Moses’ “people” of their striking characteristics and behaviors as God’s people. Exodus also discusses God’s own identity as the one who frees, who cares for the creation and people God fashioned in love, and continues to richly bless and provide for them. While Moses is meeting with the Almighty on the stormy peak of Sinai, the bored and wayward folks left down on the plain decide to fashion themselves a golden calf to have on hand for worship. Moses, seeing their radical departure from what it means to be God’s people, cries “Who is on the Lord’s side? Come to me!” No neutral spirits need apply, because to be God’s children means to live and bear witness daily to what abiding relationship with the Almighty means.",

If not, our own sadly comfortable, indifferent spirits will eventually “neutralize” the newly arrived folks hopes and energy, too. Experience demonstrates that newly baptized adults or individuals welcomed into a church community are often shocked to discover complacency and lack of energy in the very parish they had placed their hopes and aspirations. But it doesn’t have to end in such a disappointing fashion.
