This consists of making, collecting, and donating handmade blankets/quilts for infants and school-age children. All donations must be handmade (crochet, knit, cloth, rag, felt) and washable/dryable! Our donations will be taken to a group in Augusta, Georgia, which also serves Aiken, SC. As of their July newsletter, they have donated 4,304 blankets this year. Until further notice, this will be an ongoing project. We will keep a donation box in the Narthex, and as we fill it, we will take it to Bethel, and they will make the deliveries. You do not need to participate in Fiber Friends to participate in this project! Any of you who create at home, please help us provide for these young people. Remember, handmade, washable, and dryable! Fiber Friends meets on Wednesdays at 10:00 in the Youth Room downstairs. Anyone is welcome to drop in or join us. If you do not “stitch” but would like a group to sit and talk with, you are welcome also! Often, we do more talking and laughing than stitching!",
